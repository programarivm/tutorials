## What's This?

This repo is intended to hold a few tutorials on Web-related topics that I'd like to share with the world. My idea is to mainly cover PHP things -- but who knows, don't be surprised if you find something else. Stay curious!

- [Validating Doctrine Entities in the Model Layer with PHP Traits](https://github.com/programarivm/tutorials/blob/master/acme_blog/README.md)

- [Wrapping Doctrine Entities into a Singletonized Logger](https://github.com/programarivm/tutorials/blob/master/logger/README.md)
